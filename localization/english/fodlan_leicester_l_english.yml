 FOD_alliance.1.t:0 "The Alliance Calls For Aid"
 FOD_alliance.1.desc:0 "These are desperate times indeed; [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetFirstName] has called the Alliance to arms. Whether the Alliance truly faces an unprecedented threat or [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetFirstName] simply intends to further [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetHerHis] own ambitions, the fact stands that the Alliance will be plunged into turmoil. \n\nRegardless, [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetFirstName] is only the leader of the Alliance, not our overlord, and we do not need to answer the call if we do not wish to. War is not a decision to be made lightly. What shall be done?"

 FOD_alliance.2.desc.opening:0 "The politics of the Alliance are a complex and fluctuating beast that change just as the tides that beat against Derdriu. One fact remains uncontested, though; one needs support to succeed in the election. \n\n[great_lord.GetName] cannot be ignorant of this fact, for [great_lord.GetSheHe] approached me with an offer. [great_lord.GetName] will support me in the election for a time."

 FOD_alliance.2.desc.no_hook:0 "\nIn exchange, I would owe [great_lord.GetHerHim] a favor, to be repaid at a later date regarding another matter."

[first_lord.GetName] and [second_lord.GetName] are the two primary proponents of their respective arguments.  \n\n[better_diplomacy_lord.GetName] has been presenting the most sensible arguments thus far, and moreover, [better_diplomacy_lord.GetHerHis] ideas can ostensibly be put into practice.

 FOD_alliance.6.t:0 "Extra Development Funds"
 FOD_alliance.6.desc:0 "A recent windfall has graced the Alliance-- namely, a sizable donation from a wealthy merchant who wished to see Alliance land developed. The Alliance Roundtable agrees the money would best be spent on masons, carpenters, and other such skilled artisans. Each great lord predictably proposes their own territory receive this aid. Some suggest a lesser noble might receive the aid, or even my own territory. The choices fall on me."

 FOD_alliance.7.t:0 "Disparagement in Council"
 FOD_alliance.7.desc:0 "During a particularly dull session of the Alliance Roundtable wherein little progress was made, I noticed [first_lord.GetName] casting glances my way as though [first_lord.GetSheHe] had something to say. Evidently [first_lord.GetHerHis] patience wore thin, though, for [first_lord.GetSheHe] stood up and launched into a tirade. [first_lord.GetFirstName] lambasted my choice for the next ruler of the Alliance, declaring [root_choice.GetFirstName] ineffectual and altogether incompetent. \n\nOn the same breath, [first_lord.GetSheHe] presented the talent and genius of [first_lord_choice.GetFirstName] and hailed [first_lord_choice.GetHerHim] as though [first_lord_choice.GetSheHe] was the second coming of Riegan. I let [first_lord.GetName] finish, and now the baton has been passed back to me. Surely I cannot let this stand uncontested?"
 FOD_alliance.7.a:0 "Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; [first_lord.GetHerHis] candidate is worthless."

 FOD_alliance.8.desc:0 "[root_choice.GetName] had been avoiding me the entire day, much to my confusion. I do not recall doing anything to wrong them. The fault was not mine, though; I learned that [root_choice.GetName] had gotten into a brawl. I was confused as to why this was a matter of significant importance until I learned that the other party in this was [other_choice.GetName], another candidate for the election. \n\nNeither won decisively, it seems; their little scuffle ended in a draw. Perhaps if [root_choice.GetName] had won the fight, this would be no issue. Now both of their characters are being brought into question, and public opinion of them has plummeted."
 FOD_alliance.8.a:0 "A pitiful display."
 FOD_alliance.9.t:0 "Candidate Visit"
 FOD_alliance.9.desc:0 "[candidate.GetName] is in [capital.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] today to participate in a tournament celebrating an important event in Alliance history. The combat is wholly safe. The participants use only training weapons and are thoroughly protected by gear warded with magic. Combat ends on contact. It is a simple event, though I suppose it is as close to real combat as we can go without safety issues. \n\nThe event has been some fun thus far, but even in festivities one cannot forget their place as part of the Alliance. I see many opportunities surrounding [candidate.GetName]."
 FOD_alliance.9.a:0 "A convenient opportunity for a friendly conversation."
