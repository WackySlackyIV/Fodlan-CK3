Whether the Alliance truly faces an unprecedented threat or [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetFirstName] simply intends to further [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetHerHis] own ambitions, the fact stands that the Alliance will be plunged into turmoil. \n\nRegardless, [liege_desc.GetLiege.GetFirstName] is only the leader of the Alliance, not our overlord, and we do not need to answer the call if we do not wish to. War is not a decision to be made lightly. What shall be done?"

 FOD_alliance.2.desc.opening:0 "The politics of the Alliance are a complex and fluctuating beast that change just as the tides that beat against Derdriu. One fact remains uncontested, though; one needs support to succeed in the election. \n\n[great_lord.GetName] cannot be ignorant of this fact, for [great_lord.GetSheHe] approached me with an offer. [great_lord.GetName] will support me in the election for a time."

 FOD_alliance.6.desc:0 "A recent windfall has graced the Alliance-- namely, a sizable donation from a wealthy merchant who wished to see Alliance land developed. The Alliance Roundtable agrees the money would best be spent on masons, carpenters, and other such skilled artisans. Each great lord predictably proposes their own territory receive this aid. Some suggest a lesser noble might receive the aid, or even my own territory. The choices fall on me."

 FOD_alliance.7.desc:0 "During the current session of the Alliance Roundtable, [first_lord.GetName] openly discredited my choice for the next ruler of the alliance. Saying [root_choice.GetFirstName] is undeserving of such a position, and his choice [first_lord_choice.GetFirstName] would be a much better choice to lead the alliance."
