The War of Unification was one of the major [Concept('historic_incident', 'conflicts')|E] in [fodlan|E] after the founding of the [church|E].\n\nA thousand years ago, the [adrestian_empire|E] and [church|E] worked hand in hand in unifying the continent of [fodlan|E] in the [war_of_heros|E]. [adrestia|E] was once the protector and enforcer of church doctrine. New Emperors would be personally coronated by the [church|E]. \n\nYet despite the closeness of the two polities, the [church|E] failed to side with the [adrestian_empire|E] in the [war_of_independence|E] and [crescent_moon_war|E]. \n\nScarred by betrayal and unrest, the Empire drifted further and further away from the teachings of the #V Central Church#!. Continued prosecution of the [Concept('church', 'faith')|E] led to a purge of the #V Southern Church#! in 1065 [iy|E].\n\nDespite efforts by #V Archibishop Rhea#! to mend ties with the rulers of [adrestia|E] war broke out in 1180 [iy|E]."
