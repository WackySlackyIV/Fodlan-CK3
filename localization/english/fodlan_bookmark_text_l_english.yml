In the south, the mysterious Flame Emperor has been revealed as #V Edelgard von Hrelsvelg#!, heiress of the #V Adrestian Empire#!. Following the abdication of her father and coronation ceremony, Edelgard now plans a revolt against the authority of the chuch. Declaring the #V Church of Seiros#! and the #V Crest#!-bearing nobility corrupt, Empress Edelgard prepares her assault on #V Garreg Mach Monastary#!, where she once was learning with her peers but a month ago."
 Dimitri_desc: "In the north, #V Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd#!, the sole survivor of the brutal #V Tragedy of Duscur#! and the Crown Prince of Faerghus prepares the #V Holy Kingdom of Faerghus#! for war, as the Empire has declared war on the #V Church Of Seiros#! and all of #V Fódlan#!. His late father's brother, Rufus, rules as regent while dimitri himself is at #V Garreg Mach#! preparing for the Empire's attack. His days as a student are cut short by the outbreak of war and he has sworn revenge on the Flame Emperor #V Edelgard Von Hresvelg#!, believing her to be responsible for the murder of his family and friends in Duscur."
 Oswald_desc: "In the east, the #V Leicester Alliance#! has faced an untimely inheritance struggle after Godfrey, son of Alliance Leader #V Oswald von Riegan#!, suddenly passed away, and Oswald himself had fallen seriously ill. Oswald began looking for his only other child, Tiana, who had disappeared some time ago. He eventually traced her back in the eastern nation of Alymra, where she had found love and wed the #V King of Almyra#!, and bore a son, Claude. Desparate for a Riegan heir, Oswald brings Claude to Derdriu and proclaims him his heir. But now #V Claude von Reigan#! is a key piece in the defense of Garreg Mach as Edelgard has declared war on Fodlan."
 Edelgard_desc: "As the main aggressor and instigator of the #V War of Unification#!, #V Edelgard von Hvresvelg#! stands at the helm of the #V Adrestian Empire#! after requesting her installment as Emperor on behalf of her father, #V Ionius IX Von Hresvelg#!. Believing the #V Crests'#! importance in society to be overall detrimental and cruel to those without them, she vows to dismantle society to create a new #V Fódlan#!, where #V Crests#! do not define your place. However, in reaching this goal, there are few lines she is unwilling to cross, and will do anything if the ends justify the means."
 Rhea_desc: "Standing at the center of the conflict, #V Archbishop Rhea#! heads the #V Church of Seiros#! and commmands the famed #V Knights of Seiros#! from her seat at #V Garreg Mach#!. Rhea stands to capture the heretic #V Edelgard#! and purge her wicked heart, and vows to make sure of that by raising not only her entire force, but personally commanding them as well, to deal with the #V Adrestian#! threat. The #V Church#! will be fighting an uphill battle, as #V Kingdom#! and #V Alliance#! forces cannot make it in time to meet the #V Empire#! in the coming clash."
