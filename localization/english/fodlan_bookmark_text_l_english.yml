 bm_fodlan_start: "War Of Unification"
 bm_fodlan_start_desc: "The specter of war consumes #V Fódlan#! once more. In the south, the mysterious Flame Emperor has been revealed as #V Edelgard von Hrelsvelg#!, heiress of the #V Adrestian Empire#!. Following the abdication of her father and coronation ceremony, Edelgard now plans a revolt against the authority of the church. Declaring the #V Church of Seiros#! and the #V Crest#!-bearing nobility corrupt, Empress Edelgard prepares her assault on #V Garreg Mach Monastery#!, where she once was learning with her peers but a month ago."
 Dimitri_desc: "From the north is #V Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd#!, the sole survivor of the brutal #V Tragedy of Duscur#!. His late father's brother, Rufus, rules as regent preparing the #V Holy Kingdom of Faerghus#! to defend the #V Church Of Seiros#! and all of #V Fódlan#!.\n\nMeanwhile Dimitri's days as a student at #V Garreg Mach#! are cut short by the outbreak of war. Believing her to be responsible for the murder of his family and friends in Duscur, Dimitri swears revenge on the Flame Emperor #V Edelgard Von Hresvelg#! as the battle at #V Garreg Mach#! approaches."
 Oswald_desc: "In the east, the #V Leicester Alliance#! has faced an untimely inheritance struggle after Godfrey, son of Alliance Leader #V Oswald von Riegan#!, suddenly passed away, and Oswald himself had fallen seriously ill.\n\nOswald began looking for his only other child, Tiana, who had disappeared some time ago. He eventually traced her back in the eastern nation of Alymra, where she had found love and wed the #V King of Almyra#!, and bore a son, Claude.\n\nDesparate for a Riegan heir, Oswald brings Claude to Derdriu and proclaims him his heir. But now #V Claude von Riegan#! is a key piece in the defense of Garreg Mach as Edelgard has declared war on Fódlan."
 Edelgard_desc: "As the main aggressor and instigator of the #V War of Unification#!, #V Edelgard von Hvresvelg#! stands at the helm of the #V Adrestian Empire#! after requesting her installment as Emperor on behalf of her father, #V Ionius IX Von Hresvelg#!.\n\nBelieving the #V Crests'#! importance in society to be overall detrimental and cruel to those without them, she vows to dismantle society to create a new #V Fódlan#!, where #V Crests#! do not define your place.\n\nHowever, in reaching this goal, there are few lines she is unwilling to cross, and will do anything if the ends justify the means."
 Rhea_desc: "Standing at the center of the conflict, #V Archbishop Rhea#! heads the #V Church of Seiros#! and commands the famed #V Knights of Seiros#! from her seat at #V Garreg Mach#!.\n\nRhea stands to capture the heretic #V Edelgard#! and purge her wicked heart, and vows to make sure of that by raising not only her entire force, but personally commanding them as well, to deal with the #V Adrestian#! threat.\n\nThe #V Church#! will be fighting an uphill battle, as #V Kingdom#! and #V Alliance#! forces cannot make it in time to meet the #V Empire#! in the coming clash."
 Aearn_desc: "In the west, #V Aearn Macneary#! rules the #V Kingdom of Brigid#!, a land with a long history of conflict with the rest of #V Fódlan#!. The most recent #V Dagda and Brigid War#! in 1175 #V IY#! led to their defeat by the #V Adrestian Empire#!. \n\nBrigid's heir, #V Petra Macneary#!, is now a hostage of the #V Empire#!, serving under #V Edelgard#! at the officer's academy. While #V Brigid#! dutifully joins the Empire in their crusade, one wonders where their true loyalties lie.\n\nAlthough currently weak and recovering, their historic allies #V Mach#! and #V Dagda#! are always waiting for the opportunity to strike #V Fódlan#! once again."
 Cornelia_desc: "In the #V Mage City of Arianrhod#! lies #V Saint Cornelia#!, tasked with leading the defenses of the #V Kingdom of Faerghus#! from the advancing #V Adrestian Empire#!\n\nCornelia was largely credited with curing the #V Great Plague of 1165 IY#!. For her deeds, she was awarded the position of #V Court Mage#! and played a major role in the sheltering of #V Edelgard#! and #V Anselma von Arundel#! during the #V Insurrection of the Seven#!.\n\nOne wonders whether it is wise to trust the Kingdom's defenses to an #V Adrestian#! cleric and friend of #V Volkhard von Arundel#!. There too are rumors of her true personality being more sinister in nature..."
 Volkhard_desc: "At the vanguard of the #V Adrestian Empire's#! forces stands #V Volkhard von Arundel#!.\n\nMany were surprised he never took the throne himself after #V Ionius IX#! was defeated in the #V Insurrection of the Seven#! as Volkhard was one of the main instigators against the crown. A shrewd politician, Volkhard took the title of #V Imperial Regent#!, handing roles, and blame, to the other conspirators.\n\nContent with being the true power for decades, one wonders what his true goals are now a new more powerful monarch has ascended the throne. For now, it seems he is content to play his part in his niece's crusade."
 Richard_desc: "In the heartland of the #V Leicester Alliance#! is #V House Gloucester#!. Theirs is a house with a strong sense of noblesse oblige and one of the #V Five Great Houses#!. Blessed with bountiful fields and resources, #V House Gloucester#! forms the main economic might of the Alliance.\n\nBelieving Imperial Unification inevitable, #V Richard Gloucester#! sees it as their duty to save the Alliance from further devastation in another war.\n\nIn return for promising to support reconstruction after the war, #V House Gloucester#! has managed to avoid an invasion by Imperial troops.\n\nNow all that remains is to convince the other leaders to bend the knee to Emperor #V Edelgard#!, as House Gloucester presses for leadership of the #V Leicester Alliance Roundtable#! to join the winning side."
