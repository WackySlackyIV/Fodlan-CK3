Blessed by [Concept('seiros', 'Saint Seiros')|E] herself, Adrestia would remain the sole power and protector of [fodlan|E] for much of history. #V Embarr#!, the empire's capital, is the most populous and wealthy city in all of [fodlan|E], having been spared much of the war that devastated [fodlan|E] in the last three hundred years.\n\nWhile Embarr prospered, harsh measures taken to win in the [war_of_heroes|E] and [first_mach_war|E] led to eventual rebellion in the outer fringes of the Empire. The [kingdom_of_faerghus|E] successfully gained freedom in 751 [iy|E] in the [war_of_independence|E]. The Empire's eastern territories soon followed in 801 [iy|E] becoming the [leicester_alliance|E].\n\nIn 961 [iy|E], at the urging of the [Concept('church', 'Church')|E], the Empire made great sacrifices to liberate [fodlan|E] in the [almyrian_invasion|E]. Yet despite this, the [Concept('church', 'Central Church')|E] failed to support the Empire's claims to the liberated regions following the war.\n\nCiting divine providance by [seiros|E] herself, the Empire soon began promoting their own clerical leadership. A mass revolt in 1065 [iy|E] by the #V Southern Church#! was put down, leading to a schism in the faith.\n\nRelations with the rest of [fodlan|E] remained poor over the next hundred years but peace endured as the declining Empire focused on [Concept('insurrection', 'internal struggles')|E].\n\nReconciliation seemed at hand following the acceptance of the Adrestian Heir #V Edelgard#! to the [academy|E]. Few know what happened in the [academy|E] leading to the outbreak of the [war_of_unification|E] a year later."
